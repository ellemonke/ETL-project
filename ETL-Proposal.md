## Project Proposal
Gary Schulke and Ellen Hsu

We would like to conduct an ETL on Transit Systems of the World (https://www.kaggle.com/citylines/city-lines/data#). 
We're using CSV files as our source of data - we will combine the tables to find further information such as
length of track for each city or country, number of stations per city, etc.
